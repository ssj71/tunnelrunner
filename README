just a little game because I've never made a terminal game  before and I wanted to make something generative.
it still has some bugs, but it is playable enough to have fun.

just run the tunnelrunner.py file with python3.

it does depend on pynput so you may need to install that with pip3 install pynput

control it with wasd, vim keys, or arrow keys. q or esc to quit.

go as far as you can without hitting the walls or running out of fuel.
